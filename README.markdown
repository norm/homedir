home directory
==============

This is my home directory. It is based, in part, on my base, ['starter kit'] 
home directory project on github. Please see it's [README] for more description
as to why I lay things out as I do.

If you like what you see here, I would recommend forking that, not this. 

You can borrow any individual files or settings from this project and
integrate it into your fork of the base home directory project. That comes
with a script `list-home-updates` which will compare your files against the
registered copies on github. By default this runs once a week, so when I
update any of my files here that you are using wholesale, you will be
occasionally reminded to look for updates.
